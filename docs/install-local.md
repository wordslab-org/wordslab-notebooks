# Install wordslab on a Local PC

Choose 3 directories on your machine

WORDSLAB_HOME : wordslab installation scripts and virtual disk containing the Linux virtual machine OS and all applications installed by wordslab (initial size 20 GB) 
- default: c:\wordslab

WORDSLAB_WORKSPACE : virtual disk containing your projects code and data + their specific software dependencies (initial size 1 GB) 
- default: %WORDSLAB_HOME%\virtual-machines\wordslab-workspace

WORDSLAB_MODELS : virtual disk containing all the AI models initially installed by wordslab and then downloaded in the course of your projects (initial size 8 to 36 GB depending of your GPU VRAM) 
- default: %WORDSLAB_HOME%\virtual-machines\wordslab-models
		
If your machine has several physical disks or partitions, you can split your wordslab install between all of them to best use your available storage space.
	
Avoid choosing directories which are automatically synchronized with a remote storage service like OneDrive because the virtual disks files are huge and are continously updated.
	
Choose a disk with a fast reading speed for WORDSLAB_MODELS or you will have to wait several minutes each time you want load a 10+ GB model in memory.

The script wil automatically create the directories if they don't already exist.

If the Windows Subsystem for Linux is not yet installed on your machine
- the script will prompt you for administrator access
- then the script will ask you to reboot your machine once
- after reboot, relaunch the same command as above a second time to continue and finish the installation 

The installation scripts will download up to 50 GB: the install time will mainly depend on your network bandwidth.

Installation script parameters for special cases (you shouldn't need them)
- you can add the -cpu flag to the install command if you want to force a CPU-only install even if a Nvidia GPU is available on your machine 
- you can add the -name <virtual-machine-name> parameter if you want to install several versions of wordslab notebooks in parallel on the same machine: the workspace and models virtual disks will be shared between these versions (default virtual machine name: wordslab-notebooks)

## Storage directories size (MB) - Version 2025-09

Please note that the exact install size will vary for each wordslab version and also depends on your GPU memory capacity (wordslab downloads bigger models by default if your GPU has more VRAM): the numbers below should be seen as a minimum.

Minimal install size = **30 GB** (8 GB GPU with small models)
Maximal install size = **60 GB** (24 GB GPU with bigger models)
